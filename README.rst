js.marionette
*************

Introduction
============

This library packages `backbone.marionette.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`backbone.marionette.js`: http://marionettejs.com/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.marionette``) are published to some URL.
